# [Bill Xiong's](http://billxiong.com) [Textual](http://www.codeux.com/textual/) Settings
---------------------
[Textual](http://www.sublimetext.com/) is my main IRC client. This is just a backup of my settings, so I can sync across multiple machines. I have fine-tuned these to fit best with my workflow, so feel free to use whatever you find in here.

This is the folder `Default location: `cd ~/Library/Containers/com.codeux.irc.textual/Data/Library/Application\ Support/Textual\ IRC/`
` on my Mac OS X machine.

## Installation
* [Download][1] and install Textual (dev channel)
* [Install Package Control][2]
* Clone this repository into the Sublime User settings directory:

```sh
git clone git@github.com:bxio/textual-settings ~/Library/Containers/com.codeux.irc.textual/Data/Library/Application\ Support/Textual\ IRC/
```

* Restart Textual.
